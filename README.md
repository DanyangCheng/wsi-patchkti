# wsi-patchkit

`wsi-patchkit` is a small, backend-neutral library for reading patches from
whole-slide images (WSIs). Version 0.1 provides:

- TIFF and optional OpenSlide readers with a common coordinate contract;
- physical-resolution (MPP) metadata and level selection;
- target-MPP-aligned, boundary-padded patch reads;
- deterministic grid, random, indexed, and tissue-filtered sampling;
- lazy patch streams;
- an optional PyTorch `IterableDataset` adapter;
- an optional browser viewer with IIIF tiles, zooming, and panning.

Dataset manifests, labels, augmentation, model execution, and prediction output
formats intentionally remain application concerns.

## Install

The project is managed with `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

Install the optional OpenSlide adapter when the native OpenSlide library is
already available:

```bash
uv sync --extra openslide
```

For platforms supported by the `openslide-bin` wheel, the convenience extra is:

```bash
uv sync --extra openslide-binary
```

PyTorch integration is isolated in another extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra torch
```

## Browser WSI viewer

Install the optional web dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra web
```

Start the viewer by explicitly registering one or more public slide IDs:

```bash
uv run wsi-patchkit-viewer \
  --slide case-001=/data/slides/case-001.svs \
  --slide case-002=/data/slides/case-002.tif \
  --crop-output-dir /data/crops \
  --reader-pool-size 4
```

To browse every supported WSI in a folder (including subfolders), register the
directory instead. The viewer's searchable slide menu scrolls when the list is
long:

```bash
uv run wsi-patchkit-viewer --slide-dir /data/slides
```

`--slide-dir` is repeatable and can be combined with `--slide`. Recognized file
extensions are `.svs`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.ndpi`, `.mrxs`, `.scn`, `.vms`,
`.vmu`, `.bif`, and `.qptiff`.

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. The viewer supports mouse-wheel and pinch
zooming, drag panning, double-click zooming, a navigator, level-0 coordinates,
and an MPP-aware scale bar. TIFF files use the bundled tifffile reader; other
formats are routed to the optional OpenSlide reader.

Select **矩形裁剪** to place a rectangle on the slide, enter its exact level-0
`x`, `y`, width, and height, and save a PNG or JPEG on the server. Crops are
read directly from pyramid level 0 without rescaling. The server stores them in
`--crop-output-dir` (the default is `./crops`) and never overwrites an existing
file. The viewer remembers the most recently entered crop width and height when
switching slides or reloading the page. Saving submits work to a background
queue, so another crop can be positioned and submitted while earlier jobs are
still running. One crop worker is used by default; use `--crop-workers N` to
change the background concurrency.

Applications can embed the viewer server instead of using the CLI:

```python
from wsi_patchkit.web import SlideSource, create_app

app = create_app(
    {
        "case-001": SlideSource("/data/slides/case-001.svs"),
        # Supply an override when the file has no reliable MPP metadata.
        "case-002": SlideSource("/data/slides/case-002.tif", source_mpp=0.5),
    },
    crop_output_dir="/data/crops",
)
```

The server exposes a conservative subset of IIIF Image API 3 at
`/iiif/3/{slide_id}`. Paths are registered server-side and are never accepted
from request URLs. Tiles are rendered from the closest suitable native pyramid
level and returned with an ETag and private cache headers. By default, four
independent readers process different tiles concurrently; tune
`--reader-pool-size` to match available CPU, memory, and storage throughput.

## Coordinate contract

Sampler coordinates live on a virtual canvas at `target_mpp`. For example, an
`x` coordinate of 100 at 0.5 MPP means 50 micrometres from the level-0 origin.
Reader-level `read_region()` calls use OpenSlide-compatible semantics: the
location is in level-0 pixels and the requested size is in pixels of the chosen
pyramid level. `read_aligned_patch()` performs the conversion explicitly. All
rectangles use half-open `(x0, y0, x1, y1)` coverage semantics.

`read_aligned_patch()` keeps the original array-only API. Use
`read_aligned_patch_result()` when a downstream application also needs the
geometric coverage mask created by boundary padding:

```python
result = read_aligned_patch_result(reader, request, level_policy="finer")
image = result.image
geometry_valid = result.valid_mask
```

`geometry_valid` reports only pixels backed by the WSI. It has no tissue, ROI,
or annotation meaning. `level_policy="nearest"` remains the default;
`"finer"` avoids selecting a native level coarser than the target MPP when a
finer level is available. Pass `interpolation="area"` when reducing an RGB
region with area averaging; label and indexed-mask reads should continue to use
`interpolation="nearest"` with `color_mode="native"`.

## Sliding-window inference

```python
from wsi_patchkit import (
    GridSampler,
    PatchStream,
    SlideSpec,
    TiffReader,
)

reader = TiffReader()
metadata = reader.metadata("slide.tif", source_mpp=0.25)
slide = SlideSpec.from_metadata(metadata, target_mpp=0.5)
requests = GridSampler(patch_size=512, stride=256).sample([slide])

try:
    for patch in PatchStream(reader, requests):
        # patch.image is uint8 HWC; patch.request contains placement metadata.
        prediction = model(patch.image)
finally:
    reader.close()
```

The grid sampler aligns its final window with the far edge, so an inference
canvas is fully covered. Use `edge="drop"` if incomplete boundary regions should
be omitted instead.

## Reproducible random training samples

```python
from wsi_patchkit import RandomSampler, SamplingContext, SlideSpec

slides = [
    SlideSpec("a.svs", canvas_size=(120_000, 80_000), target_mpp=(0.5, 0.5)),
    SlideSpec("b.svs", canvas_size=(90_000, 70_000), target_mpp=(0.5, 0.5)),
]
sampler = RandomSampler(num_samples=20_000, patch_size=512, seed=2026)
requests = sampler.sample(slides, context=SamplingContext(epoch=3))
```

Random samples are derived from `(seed, epoch, global sample index)`. Changing
DataLoader worker count does not change the global sample set; each worker only
receives its deterministic shard.

## Tissue filtering

```python
from wsi_patchkit import TissueFilter, TissueMask

masks = {
    "a.svs": TissueMask(mask_array, canvas_size=(120_000, 80_000)),
}
filtered = TissueFilter(masks, minimum_fraction=0.05).filter(requests)
```

The tissue mask may be low resolution; it is mapped over the corresponding
target-MPP canvas. Version 0.1 consumes caller-provided masks and does not impose
a tissue-detection algorithm.

For distributed training, use `TissueRandomSampler` instead of filtering an
already-sharded request stream. It retries deterministically until every global
sample meets the threshold, so `pad` and `drop` shard policies retain equal
lengths:

```python
from wsi_patchkit import TissueRandomSampler

sampler = TissueRandomSampler(
    masks,
    num_samples=20_000,
    patch_size=512,
    minimum_fraction=0.05,
    max_attempts=100,
    seed=2026,
)
```

## Indexed sampling

`IndexedSampler` samples precomputed `PatchRequest` objects. Index serialization
is deliberately left to the caller in v0.1 so projects can use NPZ, Parquet, or
a database without coupling the core library to one storage format. Its input
only needs `__len__()` and integer `__getitem__()`, allowing lazy wrappers over
memory-mapped arrays and database-backed coordinate indexes.

## Downstream reader adapters

Applications may adapt `SlideReader` to their own dataset backend without
depending on patchkit task types. `metadata()` supplies level dimensions, MPP,
and optional `LevelInfo.pixel_format`; `read_region()` always accepts a level-0
location and a size in the selected level's pixels. A typical adapter exposes
those methods through the application's own `info/read_region/close` protocol.

Coordinate indexes remain application-owned. An adapter converts each index row
from its declared coordinate space into a `PatchRequest`, then uses
`read_aligned_patch()` or `read_aligned_patch_result()`. Labels, masks, split
membership, and target encoding stay in the downstream application.

## PyTorch adapter

```python
from wsi_patchkit import RandomSampler, SlideSpec
from wsi_patchkit.io import TiffReader
from wsi_patchkit.torch import WSIPatchIterableDataset

dataset = WSIPatchIterableDataset(
    slides,
    RandomSampler(num_samples=20_000, patch_size=512, seed=2026),
    reader_factory=TiffReader,
)
```

Each worker creates and closes its own reader. Items contain a float32 CHW
`image` tensor in `[0, 1]` plus the original `PatchRequest`.

### Distributed training and checkpoints

`WSIPatchIterableDataset` pads the final global sampling round by default, so
every distributed rank and DataLoader worker receives the same number of
requests. Padding repeats deterministic requests from the start of the epoch.
Pass `even_shards="drop"` to discard the short final round, or
`even_shards="none"` to retain the historical uneven behaviour.

Call `dataset.set_epoch(epoch)` before each new DataLoader iteration. The epoch
is stored in shared memory, so the new random stream is visible when PyTorch
uses `persistent_workers=True`.

The dataset exposes `state_dict()` / `load_state_dict()` and
`SamplingContext` exposes `state_dict()` / `from_state_dict()` for saving the
epoch and a virtual global resume cursor. Recreate the same slides and sampler
configuration before restoring the state. A training loop must set the cursor
itself at a synchronized optimizer-step boundary; worker prefetching prevents
a data iterator from knowing which prefetched samples were actually committed
by the optimizer.

`TissueFilter` deliberately remains a post-sampling filter. It can produce an
unequal number of samples per shard, so the dataset rejects it together with
the default equal-shard modes. Use `even_shards="none"` for exploratory runs or
provide a tissue-aware sampler that generates a fixed number of valid requests.
